<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>

Micropayments, transactions valued in cents or fractions of a cent, have historically been impractical under legacy financial rails. Percentage‑based fees, multi‑day settlement cycles, and reliance on centralized intermediaries make low‑value transfers uneconomical, cutting off entire categories of digital commerce.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify', marginTop: '1rem' }}>

These limitations have forced creators, developers, and small businesses into centralized platforms that aggregate payments, take substantial fees, and control audience relationships. Moony removes these barriers. Built for high‑volume, low‑value transactions, it combines extreme divisibility with near‑zero fees to make micropayments viable at a global scale. By doing so, it unlocks entirely new economic behaviors that were previously impossible or uneconomical.

## Why It Matters

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>

Micropayments are not simply smaller versions of ordinary transactions, they are a missing building block of the modern internet economy. The inability to move tiny amounts of value efficiently has shaped the digital landscape in ways that limit innovation and inclusion.

  <div className="principle-card" style={{
    border: '1px solid #e5e7eb',
    borderRadius: '0.75rem',
    padding: '1.5rem',
    marginBottom: '0',
    backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
    boxShadow: '0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'

    <div style={{

    }}>
      The impracticality of per-use billing forces consumers into subscription models, paying for more than they actually use. This all-or-nothing approach creates barriers to entry, limits access to content and services, and results in wasted spending on unused features or content. Micropayments enable true pay-per-use models that align costs with actual consumption.

    }}>
      Entire categories of applications, such as real-time metering, per-unit API calls, or machine-to-machine commerce, remain underdeveloped because payment systems cannot handle the volume or economics they require. These use cases demand high-frequency, low-value transactions that traditional payment infrastructure cannot support economically, leaving significant innovation opportunities unrealized.

      Without cost-effective direct payment rails, creators and small businesses are forced into platforms that bundle transactions, take large fees, and control access to audiences. This centralization concentrates power in a few gatekeepers, limiting competition and innovation while extracting significant value from content creators and service providers who have few alternatives.
