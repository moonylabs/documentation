<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
Moony uses a distribution model called Proof of Capital (PoC), implemented entirely through its immutable onchain Moony Reserve. Under this model, MNY enters circulation exclusively in exchange for verifiable onchain capital, ensuring that distribution is transparent, market-driven, and free from discretionary control.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
Rather than relying on private allocations, discretionary issuance, or off-chain mechanisms, participation in Moony's monetary system is tied directly to real economic commitment. Every unit of MNY unlocked into circulation corresponds to capital deposited onchain, aligning growth with genuine demand.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
The Moony Reserve retains all deposited capital as protocol liquidity, forming a persistent, verifiable foundation beneath the circulating supply. This liquidity enables redemptions and anchors Moony's monetary system in observable value, while all pricing and distribution behavior is enforced deterministically by the contract's immutable logic.

## Capital-Based Mining

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
Moony's Proof of Capital (PoC) mechanism offers a capital-based alternative to traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) distribution models. Instead of relying on specialized hardware and energy-intensive computation to compete for block rewards, PoC allows any participant to unlock MNY by depositing USDF directly into the onchain Moony Reserve. This shifts distribution from computational competition to direct, verifiable economic participation.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
Because PoC does not depend on proprietary equipment, geographic concentration, or access to industrial-scale infrastructure, participation remains open on equal terms to anyone with access to the network. This design aligns Moony's distribution model with its role as open monetary infrastructure, lowering structural barriers to entry and enabling broad, global participation from the outset.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
Under this model, mining functions as a constructive economic process rather than an extractive one. Each deposit unlocks MNY from the pre-minted supply while simultaneously adding redeemable onchain liquidity to the system. Participation strengthens the monetary foundation of the network itself, rather than externalizing costs or concentrating rewards.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
By combining PoC with Solana's efficient execution environment, Moony establishes a distribution model designed for long-term sustainability and open access. Each token unlocked contributes to deeper liquidity, ensures that growth reflects genuine demand, and supports a self-reinforcing framework for the circulation of a scarce digital asset as a shared public good.
