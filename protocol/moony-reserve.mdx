The Moony Reserve is the trustless mechanism through which all MNY enters circulation. Rather than relying on discretionary allocation, private sales, or centralized control, the entire MNY supply is held in a smart contract that releases tokens into circulation according to transparent, immutable rules. This ensures that every unit of MNY is acquired on equal terms, with no special access or preferential treatment.
