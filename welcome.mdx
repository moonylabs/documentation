<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>Moony is an open monetary protocol designed to enable permissionless payments without intermediaries. Using a Proof of Capital mechanism, the protocol governs trustless distribution and redemption of a fixed-supply digital currency backed by verifiable onchain capital.</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>The protocol operates as shared infrastructure rather than a managed platform. There are no gatekeepers, no privileged access, and no centralized control over issuance or circulation. Participation is open to anyone on equal terms, and the system's rules are enforced entirely by immutable onchain logic.</p>

## About Moony Labs

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>

Moony was deployed by Moony Labs, LLC. as a decentralized monetary protocol designed to operate as a digital public good. The system runs on open-source infrastructure and is governed entirely by immutable smart contract logic, with no ongoing control over issuance, pricing, or circulation by any organization. Once deployed, the protocol functions independently, evolving through open participation rather than centralized management.
