## Images

### Using Markdown

The markdown syntax lets you add images using the following code:

```md
![title](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed.

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use embeds to add images:

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

## Embeds and HTML Elements

<Tip>
Mintlify supports HTML tags in Markdown. This is helpful if you prefer HTML tags to Markdown syntax, and lets you create documentation with infinite flexibility.

### iFrames

Loads another HTML page within the document. Most commonly used for embedding videos.

```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"> </iframe>
```
