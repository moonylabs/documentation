<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>The Moony network is a decentralized, permissionless system shaped through independent participation rather than centralized control. It operates as open digital infrastructure where participation requires no identity, approval, or privileged access. Growth emerges organically from individuals and groups who choose to build, integrate, and transact with Moony, and the value of the underlying asset reflects that collective adoption.</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>Although the protocol was deployed by Moony Labs, LLC., it operates independently and without ongoing governance. Its evolution is driven by open collaboration on a shared foundation, advancing Moony as a digital public good.</p>
